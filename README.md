# nearbyPong
It's an Android game which uses Nearby API https://developers.google.com/nearby/ to interact with other users.
The user is able to connect with another user in the same area by using Bluetooth and Wifi to establish a connection, but they might not be necessary connected to any common network.

So, using the Pong game's (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) concept and adding the Tron Legacy film's theme (https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film589915.html) we created this awesome and fun game.

Enjoy!
